<!--change log May 1 2023: I've cleaned up the code a bit, I mixed some typos and repeats, and I changed the CSS to make it my own. -->
<!--change log May 3 2023: I changed the code so that now you have to guess a number between 1-1000. I kept the number of guesses the same to make it more challenging. I also added a gradient background to the CSS-->
<!--change log May 4 2023: I've continued to improve, testing the game and CSS. I have added images to the site.-->
<!--change log May 9 2023: Created different divisions, changed the position of the strawberry images, improved the JS code (kept favoring numbers 1-100).-->
<!--change log May 11 2023: I fixed/found a layout I liked for the strawberries, and more importantly, I fixed the problem where you would end up getting a "negative amount of remaining guesses".-->
<!--change log May 15 2023: I've begun work on adding an Answer Streak, to keep track of how many times you got the correct answer..-->
<!--change log May 16 2023: I think I have finished the answer streak. I also increased the number of guesses, it is now 12 instead of 10-->
